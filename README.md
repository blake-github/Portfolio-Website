# Portfolio-Website
Semester project for comp6000

**Group members:** Blake Moore

**Title:** Blake Moore Portfolio Website

**Problem Statement:** I currently do not have a site or page that potential employers can visit to see my past work and accomplishments.

**Purpose and Scope:** The purpose of this project is to create a site to communicate my information and experience to potential employers. The scope of this project is to effectively show many different aspects of me as a person. There will be different sections to the site to show my course work, my personal work, and my professional work experiences. After visiting this site the user should have a good sense of me as a worker and a person.
